{"title": "Speechtotext", "content": "== Overview ==\nThe Audio API offers two main speech-to-text functions: transcriptions and translations, utilizing the Whisper model. It allows transcribing audio into its original language or translating and transcribing it into English. Supported upload formats include mp3, mp4, wav, with a 25 MB size limit.\n\n== Quickstart: Transcriptions ==\nTo transcribe, provide an audio file and desired output format. The API returns text in JSON by default but can be set to other formats. It supports additional parameters for customization.\n\n== Quickstart: Translations ==\nThis function translates and transcribes audio into English from any supported language, differing from the transcription endpoint, which maintains the original language.\n\n== Supported Languages ==\nThe API supports multiple languages, focusing on those with high accuracy in transcription. Languages include English, German, Chinese, and many more.\n\n== Timestamps ==\nThe API can produce transcripts with timestamps for each word, enhancing precision in video edits.\n\n== Handling Longer Inputs ==\nFor files larger than 25 MB, audio must be split into smaller segments. Tools like PyDub can assist in this process.\n\n== Use of Prompts ==\nPrompts can improve transcription accuracy by providing context, correcting errors, and maintaining styling preferences like punctuation and capitalization.\n\n== Improving Reliability ==\nChallenges include recognizing uncommon terms or acronyms, which can be mitigated using prompts and post-processing solutions like GPT-4."}
